# Noughts & Crosses

A Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) game created in Python 3. 

This game can be played by up to two players on one machine.

## How to play

At the start of the game, players decided whether they want to be either noughts (0) or crosses (x). Players then take it in turns to place their marker on the board. The first player to create a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of three-in-row wins the game.
